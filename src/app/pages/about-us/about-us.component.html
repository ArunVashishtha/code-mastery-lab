         <p>Code mastery lab was founded in 2023 by two engineers who were passionate about helping others succeed in their careers. We believe that everyone should have access to high-quality interview questions, regardless of their experience level. That's why we offer our questions for free to everyone.

            In addition to our interview questions, we also offer a variety of other resources to help you prepare for your next interview. These resources include blog posts, articles, and video tutorials.
            
            We are committed to helping you succeed in your career. That's why we offer our services for free. We believe that everyone should have the opportunity to achieve their dreams.
